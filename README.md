# On-demand micro-services deployment for Kubernetes via HTTP endpoints

## Enabling applications in your Kubernetes cluster to programmatically install helm charts and expose them throughÂ a single public facing IP

The solution exposes web endpoint which provides the Helm functionalities of Install, Delete and Upgrade charts, as well as automatically configure the ingress controller to expose them to the internet all within a single public IP.
The solution we propose consists of two parts, both as web servers:

**Helm charts deployer**: let developers install, delete and upgrade helm charts from inside the cluster, using a simple REST API.

**Ingress rule setter**: expose installed helm charts to the internet, via a single IP.

### When to use this solution

* Automating deployments in the cluster.
* Programmatically managing the cluster from the code.

### Requirements

* Kubernetes 1.9+ with RBAC enabled.
* Helm

### Installation

1. Install [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) with [RBAC](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/rbac.md#tiller-and-role-based-access-control)

    Make sure to grant tiller sufficient permissions to run helm inside the cluster, and install the app Chart.
    The example below will configure helm and tiller to work with the chart's default values. Execute the following lines if using the default chart values:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/k8s-On-demand-micro-services-deployment/master/rbac-example/tiller.yaml

    helm init --service-account tiller
    ```
2. Clone the repository
    * [Build and push](https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/builds/push-images/) the image into a docker repository

    ```bash
    docker build -t registryname/on-demand-micro-services-deployment-k8s .
    docker push registryname/on-demand-micro-services-deployment-k8s
    ```

    * Edit the [values.yaml](./chart/on-demand-micro-services-deployment-k8s/values.yaml) file to point to the newly published image and registry

3. Install the app chart

    ```bash
    helm install chart/on-demand-micro-services-deployment --name on-demand-micro-services-deployment --set rbac.create=true
    ```

4. Call on-demand-micro-services-deployment-k8s and install `nginx-ingress-controller`, to expose other helm charts via a single public IP:

    ```bash
    curl -d '{"chartName":"stable/nginx-ingress", "releaseName":"myingress"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://<on-demand-micro-services-deployment-k8s-ip>:4000/install
    ```

5. Label each ingress controller. This is required, since this is our way of telling the system, which IPs to use:

    ```bash
    kubectl label service myingress-nginx-ingress-controller appingress=ingress
    ```

Now to see in action, try wordpress.sh for installing wordpress through helm with the help of helm-web-api.

Now you have a working API awaiting HTTP requests.

## Using the API

If you used the default settings, the API will be accessible internally at: `http://on-demand-micro-services-deployment-k8s.default.svc.cluster.local:4000`

Here is a quick node.js snippet that makes use of the API to install RabbitMQ with default settings.

Note: any chart will be suitable, RabbitMQ is just a specific example:

```js
let chart = { name: "stable/rabbitmq", servicePort: 5672 };

// perform helm install
var installResponse = await requestPostAsync(Paths.HelmInstall, { form: { chartName: "" } });

// create a rule to expose the new service expternally
var ingressResponse = await requestGetAsync(Paths.SetIngressRule, { serviceName: installResponse.serviceName, servicePort: chart.servicePort });

return `Your new service: ${ingressResponse.releaseName}, is publicly accessible on ${ingressResponse.ip}:${ingressResponse.port}`;
```

For example, installig a chart from a private repository is done by sending the following json to the exposed endpoint:

```json
{
  "chartName":"sampleApp",
  "releaseName":"sampleApp1",
  "privateChartsRepo": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/helm_repo/master/index.yaml"
}
```

In most cases the deployed chart will be a private one, which makes sense to be deployed on demand, for example a service which adds support for a new format of requests. However, public charts are fully supported (remove the 'privateChartsRepo' key-value).
